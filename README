This is nfstHUD. It's horrible. 

Credit to povohat and Barrakketh for inspiring me to make this horrible thing.

Where does this hud deviate from the original?
  - Outline used on several hud elements, as a replacement for the artificial drop shadow elements. The outline might remind you of ells hud.
  - Slight positional differences of some hud elements.
  - Yellow hud crosshair
  - Larger, bright green damae indicators
  - Some other shit.

This makes it looks like I actually worked on it. This is merely an illusion. I am a horrible intellectual property thief.
